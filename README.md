## About Monkey Market
>### "A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts."

While this was meant in jest to illustrate how poor humans are at chosing stocks, a recent study found that on average randomized selection was better than professional stock brokers and index and mutual funds. We wanted to see just how true this claim was so we created a fintech app that does just that.

On average, our method of what is essentially "monkeys throwing darts" outperforms the top 5 index funds by 4% over 1000 randomized trials. So it truely is the right choice for any investor.
