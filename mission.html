            <p>At MarketMonkey, we believe that monkeys are smarter than you think. That's why we hired them to pick stocks for us. No, really. Economics professors have said for decades that humans picking stocks was a process wrought with failure, that something as crazy as training monkeys to throw darts at a list of stock indexes would be more fruitful than letting our supposedly superior brains pick stocks. Here in San Luis Obispo, it's very difficult and borderline unethical to put monkeys up to the task, so our code monkeys came up with the next best thing: RNG. Our stock picking process simulates the apes that aggregate the stocks that will net you the big bucks, and we'll prove it too, by pitting it alongside the best index funds that the financial experts from Wall Street could muster. All of this, so we could put the "wildest" stock market theory to the test.</p>
